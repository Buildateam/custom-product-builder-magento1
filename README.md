# Custom Product Builder For Magento 1 By Buildateam

React.js (Javascript) + Canvas + HTML5 + Magento 1

Offer an easy and engaging way to order custom made-to-order products.

Our plugin works with png images of the same size with transparent backgrounds. Each png image represents a layer on the product preview. By stacking images representing different product parts on top of each other you can create a full representation of the product and offer a true ‘Build Your Own Product’ experience.

This app is very flexible and can work with almost an unlimited number of product types: jewelry, apparel, cars, accessories, musical instruments, furniture, sports equipment etc.. We believe that the world would be a better place if more people could order custom products.

This plugin is the first iteration of our the Custom Product Builder Plugin  and has a very limited functionality.
